run J_Editor.java from the editor package

when adding components to an object from the extend menu,
you must have a second object in the outliner tab and switch between

in order to view the effects of input bindings on an object,
you must click the play button, and to exit fullscreen, you must
press alt+f4

router up with the correct port forwarding settings
